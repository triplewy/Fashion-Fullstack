## Philosophy:

Three words that best describe the philosophy of this startup: Underground, stats, tags

* Underground

‘Underground’ refers to discoverability and is implemented through reposting, playlist following, genres, and an explore page similar to that of reddit. One of the biggest drivers of small artists ‘blowing up’ is the repost or retweet. If you’ve used Soundcloud or Twitter, you’ve probably seen how people can quickly gain mass followings and traction as a result of reposts piling on top of each other. As for playlist following, I find that people in fashion also love to create ‘inspo albums’ which are essentially collections of fit pics. Seeing that Spotify has built the largest music platform on the planet based on sharing and following playlists, I figure that playlist following could be a great feature in a fashion social media platform as well. Lastly the explore page should work similar to that reddit in that one can see a ‘front page’ organized based on either ‘hot’ or ‘new’. The idea of subreddits can be implemented through genres as well. This will also provide an incentive for small creatives to ‘make it’ to the front page in a sense, which is a major component of Youtube.

* Stats

’Stats’ is what it sounds like, but this will be by far the most difficult thing to implement on a image sharing social media platform. How does one track views based on users just scrolling through their feeds? Sending a server request after a user has scrolled past each post does not seem practical so figuring out a solution in calculating views will need a lot of thinking and experimentation. Also, what stats are relevant to startup brands and fashion influencers? What should this website keep track of? How can we provide a sense of progression and game-ability to the platform to make users continue using it?  

* Tags

’Tags’ are the most important aspect for startup brands looking to showcase and sell their own designs on the website. Tags on this website will be much more detailed in that they will feature a brand name, item name, original boolean, and option to provide a link. Users will get to see exactly what clothing of item are in posts and can search the platform based on those tags or click on optional links to direct them to buying these clothes.
